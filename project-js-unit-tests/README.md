## JS Unit Tests

Project made while studying at Trybe, a web development school.

### Skills Involved

 - Make Unit Tests for functions using __Jest__, a powerful framework of tests in __JavaScript__, to verify the correct operation of these functions.
 - From already implemented tests, write functions in a way to attend to these tests.
 - Write tests and functions in a __Test Driven Development__ (TDD) way.
